Codewars is a gym for the mind. These files are the chalk marks on the wall. A personal archive of **Codewars kata solutions**, organized by programming language.

> [!WARNING]
> Each solution proudly rejects clarity and correctness, embracing idiotic hacks and fragile cleverness instead.

## Notes

- Katas range from trivial exercises to needlessly overcomplicated brain damage.
- Solutions may evolve, usually sideways, occasionally backwards.
- Readability loses to golfing. Always.
